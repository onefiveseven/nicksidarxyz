<h1>READ_ME</h1>

<p>this website is my (Nicholas Sidarchuk) erasmus+ portfolio submission for Design Art Technology in ArtEZ Arnhem. I manually coded this website for the application. </p>
 
<p>a lot of my work explores where humans, nature and technology intersect. i have an interest in how our modern technological society impacts humanity, nature and our environment. </p>     
    
<p>i had to learn basic html and css. i wish i would've had the time to implement some javascript into the website but i am still yet to learn those skills.
</p>
       

<p>please take your time looking through.</p>

<p>+ enjoy :D</p>
